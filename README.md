# Deep Learning Insurance Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts insurance purchase likelihood based on customer demographics and affordability factors using deep learning techniques.

## üìä Project Overview

This project implements a deep learning model to predict whether a customer is likely to purchase insurance based on their age and affordability status. The model uses neural networks to learn patterns from historical customer data and provides predictions for new customers.

### Key Features

- **Binary Classification**: Predicts insurance purchase (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- **Feature Engineering**: Utilizes age and affordability as predictive features
- **Deep Learning Model**: Neural network implementation using TensorFlow/Keras
- **Data Visualization**: Comprehensive analysis and visualization of results
- **Model Evaluation**: Multiple evaluation metrics and performance analysis
